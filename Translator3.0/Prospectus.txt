		--Translator3.0 Prospectus--

	File I need:
1) Trans.h Trans.cpp
	this is a translation API , using 'google translate' , it's a little complex for me , but it's also easy!
2) TransDlg.h TransDlg.cpp
	this is a mian window, which is contain two Edits. and one of Edits is input Edits, and other is output Edit.
3) CtrlFun.h CtrlFun.cpp 
	It includes all functions that control translate dialog action.

	Function I need
1) automatic hiding or show Translate Window.
2) using Ctrl+Shift+I to input Translated Text, using Ctrl+S to save Translate Results, using Ctrl+P to open or close auto play word audio. 
3) play words audio.
4) saving and reading translate result and pronunciation audio.


	What is difficult for me:
1) I need to write Trans.cpp which is contain google translate API, but google translate have a key to verify whether this request come from explorer, and different word at the different time with different key algorithm. so I need some time to analyse it(Maybe I need one day).
2) I'll use the new IDE which is called Visual Studio, It will take me some time to know that.
3) I must use Google to find what I need, It means I must use english(It'll take me much time)!
4) others ......
